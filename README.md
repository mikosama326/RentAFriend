# Rent a Friend
## Or, less creepily, Find a Friend

This is our Programming the Web mini-project, a slightly questionable website where people can meet other people with similar interests. Literally. Kind of.

Don't worry, you don't have to be impressed.

Who are we?
We're ninjas who like to eat cake and make fun of other people with/without their permission. You might find us in a corner of the room staring at people and giggling to each other about them. It's our thing. Don't question it.
